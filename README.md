go gl demo work with dreams of applications to chat, interplanetary flight, and conquest of the post-tensor manifolds

yea


pics or it didn't happen

```bash
./goad init
./goad run
```

Basic UI demos from the UI library for sanity testing can be built separately:

```bash
./goad init
./goad demo-gxui
./.gopath/bin/polygon
```

Sorry, `init` has some apt-get installs for headers.
Don't worry; you *don't* need them to *run* the application once built.
