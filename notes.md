### relating to message uid and delivery sanity

https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0079.html -- "Advanced Message Processing" -- mostly madness about "time-sensitive" messages, but also includes declaration of "id" attribute in "message" tag, which is supposed to be "unique".
https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0198.html -- stream management
https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0060.html -- publish-subscribe
https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0184.html -- message acking

https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0280.html -- message carbons -- this is probably the *most* relevant by far: it's actually specifically designed to do log replication between clients.
https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0313.html -- Message Archive Management -- sounds like maybe this should just supercede some of those earlier numbers?
