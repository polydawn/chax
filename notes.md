### relating to message uid and delivery sanity

https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0079.html -- "Advanced Message Processing" -- mostly madness about "time-sensitive" messages, but also includes declaration of "id" attribute in "message" tag, which is supposed to be "unique".
https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0198.html -- stream management
https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0060.html -- publish-subscribe
https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0184.html -- message acking
