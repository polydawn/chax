### Please stop:

```
fatal error: GL/glx.h: No such file or directory
#include <GL/gl.h>

Embed the fucking headers.  My users aren't going to recompile per host; that means my dev environment shouldn't have per-host reference either.  Ever.

... Then again, glfw is embedded in here, and we appear to be recompiling it, and it's importing big swaths of standard lib stuff, so... my hands are raised in supplication; I give up.
